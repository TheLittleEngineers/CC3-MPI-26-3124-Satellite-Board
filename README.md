Note: the following installation instructions are provided as information
only, and the installer assumes all responsibility in dealing with this
modification.  If you are not absolutely sure you can do this 
modification, and can fix anything you accidently break, it is HIGHLY
suggested you instead take your Multipak Interface to Radio Shack and let 
them have the modification done by their service technicians.  The cost
should be somewhere around $30.

  1. Remove the MPI case
  2. Remove the three screws holding the logic board to the bottom case, 
  leaving the transformer connected.  Remove all the metal clips holding 
  the shield to the bottom of the PCB, noting their positions.  Remove 
  the shield.  This is to avoid melting through the shield insulation 
  while soldering.
  3. Cut the trace coming from pin 52 of IC6 that connects pin 52 of IC6 
  to pin 19 of IC1.
  4. Position the satellite board over IC6, components up, with the 7 
  wires facing towards the card edge.
  5. Connect the 3 yellow wires to IC4 pins 3,9, and 11.  Any order is 
  fine.
  6. Connect the white wire to IC6 pin 52, taking care not to short the 
  leads of IC6.
  7. Connect the blue wire to IC1 pin 19.
  8. Connect the black wire to IC5 pin 8.
  9. Connect the red wire to IC5 pin 16.
  10. Replace the shield and two of the logic board screws.. the one 
  nearest the power switch, and the one near the selector switch.
  11. Place the plastic spacer over the hole for the third screw. 
  Position the hole in the satellite board over the spacer with the 
  components up.  Insert the screw into the board and tighten.  The board 
  must be positioned parallel to the edge card connector so that it fits 
  into the channel between the cabinet top and the cartridge frame.  
  Replace the cabinent top.
  12. Test the unit by connecting it to a CoCo, installing a cartridge in 
  each slot, and checking to see that each slot is selectable and 
  accessable.
